## Running

install all dependencies:

`pip install -r requeriments.txt`

install the main script:

## Authentication

Uploading to Bunkr requires the user to be registered, so you will need to get your
token from your account's dashboard (*account tokens/codes* section). 

You also need to provide your account cookies (as json) cause Bunkr disabled file upload without login in.
You can get your account cookies installing [Cookie-Editor](https://github.com/moustachauve/cookie-editor) on your browser

You may need to provide an album name that doesn't already exist in your account (**untested**).
